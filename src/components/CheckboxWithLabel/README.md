## Checkbox with label component (incomplete)

Takes in two props, a `value` to determine whether it's ticked or not.
Another is `labelText` which will render a label with that text.

30 mins isn't a lot of time, I would've liked to hook up the change handlers so you can
actually toggle the switch. As well as adding a click handler to the label itself so it
can be used to toggle the checkbox. I am aware that I could use IDs to do the same thing, 
but then I'd have to worry about generating unique IDs.
